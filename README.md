# Dungeon-World-The-Corrupted-World

This piece was made for the purposes of starting and practicing creating Dungeon World games for others to use in ther own sessions if they are looking for variety content. I have this game set up in a way that the GM has a good amount of freedom on how to make the world for the players after the start. The players will also have unique actions that they can perform to confront situations, such as during battle actions.
